## Motivation
BlockCarbon offers an independent and non-profit approach to carbon credit standard and tokenization. It's preferred blockchain is Cardano which offers superior security, lower costs and better scalability than Ethereum. Existing projects that have been retired and tokenized as ERC-20 tokens can to avoid double counting not easily move between blockchains.

Holders of ERC-20 carbon tokens might consider migrating to the Cardano blockchain for a vast number of reasons:

* Lower Transaction Fees: Cardano often touts lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum, especially during network congestion periods.

* Scalability: Cardano uses the Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake protocol, which aims to achieve higher throughput and scalability compared to Ethereum's current Proof-of-Work (though Ethereum is transitioning to Proof-of-Stake).

* Sustainability: Cardano's emphasis on a more energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake mechanism makes it a more eco-friendly choice compared to traditional Proof-of-Work blockchains.

* Formal Verification: Cardano's emphasis on formal methods and formal verification seeks to offer higher assurance of smart contract correctness.

* Interoperability: Cardano is building its platform with a focus on interoperability with other blockchains, aiming to create a more interconnected ecosystem.

* Governance: Cardano has a built-in governance system (Project Catalyst) that allows token holders to have a say in the future development and funding of projects on the platform.

* Research-Driven Approach: Cardano's development process is heavily research-driven, with many of its protocols and mechanisms peer-reviewed.

* Native Tokens: Cardano supports native tokens without the need for smart contracts, aiming for simpler token mechanics and reduced complexity and fees.

* Security: Cardano claims enhanced security through its extended UTXO model, which offers certain advantages over the account-based model in Ethereum.

* Rich Contract Model: With the introduction of Plutus smart contracts, Cardano aims to offer a more flexible and powerful contract environment.
